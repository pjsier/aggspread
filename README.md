# `aggspread`

[![Build status](https://github.com/pjsier/aggspread/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pjsier/aggspread/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

A CLI tool based on Conveyal's [`aggregate-disser`](https://github.com/conveyal/aggregate-disser/) for spreading aggregated GeoJSON feature data throughout points inside overlapping spread features. An example would be distributing population data from Census block groups into random points within contained residential parcels.
